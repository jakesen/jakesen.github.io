It started when we decided we couldn't afford our second car payment. Getting out of debt was a top priority, and it just didn't make sense to have $250 per month (plus insurance) going to pay for a car that we could probably do without. Plus, with my new office only being a couple miles away, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to try what I had been wanting to do for years...bicycle commuting.

The first thing I noticed after riding to work just a few times was how great I felt! I've worked an office job for the better part of the last 15 years, and I know I don't get the exercise that I should. Even though I like the idea of getting into an exercise habit, it always seems like I'm just too busy, too tired, and it doesn't happen.

Riding to work is different. It's not just exercise for the sake of exercise (even though it has all the same benefits). It serves the practical purpose of getting me where I need to go. Sure, I could get my wife to bring me to work and back each day, and sometimes I do. But that is costing extra gas and taking time out of her busy schedule every time she gives me a ride. It only takes about 20 minutes for me to get to work on my bicycle, about the same as the round trip time for my wife to drive me and then drive back home. That's 20 minutes of her time plus 10 minutes of my time, versus just 20 minutes of my time. Plus when I take my bike I can go to work and come home whenever I need to regardless of whether my wife is available to drive me.

As a household, my bicycle commute saves us money and time!

Back to the health benefits...it's a proven fact that regular exercise makes you a healthier, happier person. I really can feel the difference when I have cycled several times in the past couple days. My body feels stronger. I have more stamina. Aches and pains are somehow less significant, like they don't bother me as much. And it seems like the older I get, the more I notice the difference in how I feel with exercise versus without.

Bicycling to work has also changed how I experience life. Those 40 minutes a day of being outdoors, breathing the fresh air, smelling the flowers and trees, give me more of a close, personal view of our town than I would
