I have been playing with computers for a long time, and working as a professional developer since 2002. I am luckily married to a kick ass wife without whom I would be utterly lost as I try to help raise our three daughters. I love technology, but also simplicity and elegance of design whether found in software or other forms of craftsmanship.

At one time or another I have used Tcl/Tk, Visual Basic, C#, C++, Perl, PHP, JavaScript, ActionScript, Python, Ruby and other various programming languages. I've deployed and managed websites and applications on managed hosting, Amazon Web Services and Heroku using things like Linux, Apache, MySQL and PostgreSQL.
